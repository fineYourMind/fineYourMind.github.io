1. General Information

Ovella is a mobile application designed to help users track their menstrual cycle in a calm, private, and respectful way.
Protecting user privacy is a core principle of Ovella. The application is built according to the concept of privacy by design.

Ovella:
- does not display advertisements,
- does not sell user data,
- does not use advertising identifiers,
- does not track users for marketing purposes.

2. Data Collected by the Application

Ovella may process the following types of data only if the user chooses to enter them:
- cycle-related information (e.g. period dates, cycle length),
- daily logs (such as mood, symptoms, well-being, notes),
- app preferences (language, reminders, settings).

Ovella does not require account creation to function.

3. How Data Is Stored

By default, all user data is stored locally on the user’s device.
Ovella does not upload user data to external servers.

Optional Cloud Backup (Ovella Plus)

If the user enables the optional backup feature:
- data is saved to the user’s private Google Drive App Data space,
- backups are encrypted before upload,
- Ovella cannot access, read, or share this data.

Enabling or disabling backup is fully controlled by the user.

4. Purpose of Data Processing

User data is processed only to provide app functionality, including:
- displaying the cycle calendar,
- generating estimated cycle information,
- showing trends and summaries,
- scheduling local reminders (if enabled).

Ovella does not use data for:
- medical diagnosis,
- treatment recommendations,
- advertising,
- profiling or behavioral tracking.

All information displayed in the app is provided for informational purposes only.

5. Medical Disclaimer

Ovella is not a medical device and does not provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
All estimates shown in the app are informational and should not be considered medical guidance.
Users should consult qualified healthcare professionals for medical concerns.

6. Data Sharing

Ovella does not share user data with third parties.
Data is never sold, rented, or transferred for marketing or analytics purposes.

7. Permissions

Ovella may request optional permissions, such as:
- notifications (for reminders),
- biometric authentication (for app lock, if enabled),
- Google Drive access (only if backup is enabled).

Permissions are used strictly for their stated purpose and can be revoked at any time via system settings.

8. Data Retention and Deletion

All data remains on the device unless the user deletes it.
Users can delete their data at any time by clearing app data or uninstalling the app.
If cloud backup is enabled, deleting the backup removes stored copies from Google Drive.

Ovella does not retain any user data after deletion.

9. Children’s Privacy

Ovella is not intended for use by children under the age of 13.
The application does not knowingly collect personal data from children.

10. Changes to This Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated to reflect changes in the app or legal requirements.
The latest version will always be available on the official Ovella website.
